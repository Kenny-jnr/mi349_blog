          Routine is so important to me. As the day is made up of 24 hours, I share my Life into 3 equal parts of 8 hours. I guess we have already skipped the first 8 hours which is <em>SLEEP!</em> It is important to have at least 8 hours so I do not wake up looking like bugs bunny. The other two 8 hours are Learning and Life. I wake up every morning by 8, except from Tuesdays where I have to fufill my 8am class sentence for the rest of the semester, Tuesdays are so cruel. I wake up to music from my morning playlist, it gets me hyped for the day after all music is life. After I get out of bed, I make my bed, brush my teeth, and drink water. Breakfast is interesting as I am always easting the same thing, it is either eggs and bacon or pancakes. I shower for a good 15 mins, then I face the greatest task of the day yet, figuring out a fit for work or school. Living off campus has its benefits, but I do not own a car yet so I have to use the bus every day to get to work or school. I guess that is the beauty of making a blog in the day of my life.
